Thank you for your interest in the Bonsai Foundation CIC (the “Foundation”). To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Foundation must have on file a signed Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") from each Contributor, indicating agreement with the license terms below.

This agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Foundation and its users. It does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Please complete and sign either the Individual or Corporate CLA:

* If you are an individual contributing original work and you are sure you own the intellectual property of your Contributions, then you  need to sign the [Individual CLA](/assets/icla.pdf).
* If you work for an organization that wants to allow you to submit Contributions, then you will need to sign the [Corporate CLA](/assets/ccla.pdf).

## Terms and Conditions

By submitting Contributions, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions. In return, the Foundation shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to its goal of making all Contributions freely available to everyone or inconsistent with the [Community Interest Statement](foundation.md). Except for the license granted herein to the Foundation and recipients of Contributions distributed by the Foundation, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1.	**Definitions.**  
  "**You**" (or "**Your**") means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.  
  "**Contribution**" means code, designs, documentation or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, submitted by You (by any means and in any form) to the Foundation for inclusion in, or documentation of, or for the purpose of discussion or improvement of any of the projects owned or managed by the Foundation (the "**Work**") but excluding communication that is clearly marked in writing by You as "***Not a Contribution.***"

2.	**Grant of Licenses.**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Foundation and recipients of Contributions distributed by the Foundation a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, irrevocable:  
  (a)	**copyright license** to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and derivative works.  
  (b)	**patent license** to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work. This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. The license terminates if patent litigation is filed against You or any other entity alleging patent infringement.

3.	**Confirmation of Ownership and Rights to Submit.**  
  3.1	You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license and that the Contribution is your original creation.  
  3.2	If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Foundation, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Foundation.

4.	**Third Party Rights.** You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction which you are aware of.

5.	**Submitting work which is not Yours.** If you wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it separately to the Foundation, providing complete details of its source and of any associated license or other restriction and clearly marking the work as "***Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]***".

6.	**No warranties.** Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. You are not obliged to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You want to or agreed between us in writing. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

7.	**Your obligation to tell us if anything changes.** You agree to notify the Foundation of any facts or circumstances you become aware of that would make your representations inaccurate. 

8.	**How the Foundation processes Your Personal Data.** When You provide a Contribution, the Foundation collects and stores the information and content in Your Contribution, including information required to confirm the provenance of intellectual property contained in Your Contribution, and the personal information that You make available in submitting Your Contribution. The Foundation may also collect and process content and personal data that You submit in connection with the Work, including collaboration and communication records, such as on mailing lists, blogs, wiki pages and issue trackers, and any related services. The Foundation will only process Your personal data for the purposes of managing its open-source projects, to comply with applicable laws and for activities directly related to the use of Your Contribution.
